## I need a feature

Feature request from anyone is definitely welcomed! Actually, since 0.2, many features are proposed and/or contributed by non-core members, e.g. [#105](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/105), [#142](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/142), [#252](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/252), with various degrees of involvement. We could take on feature proposals if it benefits everyone, but definitely code contributions will be highly appreciated.
