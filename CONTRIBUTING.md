# Contributing to SeaQL

Thank you for taking the time to read this. First of all, star ALL our repos!

SeaQL is a community driven project. We welcome you to participate, contribute and together build for SeaQL's future.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [SeaQL Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SeaQL/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I have a question

If you got a question to ask, please do not open an issue for it. It's quicker to ask us on [SeaQL Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/uCPdDXzbdv) or open a [GitHub Discussion](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart#creating-a-new-discussion) on the corresponding repository.

## I need a feature

Feature request from anyone is definitely welcomed! Actually, since 0.2, many features are proposed and/or contributed by non-core members, e.g. [#105](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/105), [#142](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/142), [#252](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/252), with various degrees of involvement. We will implement feature proposals if it benefits everyone, but of course code contributions will more likely be accepted.

## I want to join

We are always looking for long-term contributors. If you want to commit longer-term to SeaQL's open source effort, definitely talk with us! There may be various form of "grant" to compensate your devotion. Although at this stage we are not resourceful enough to offer a stable stream of income to contributors.

## I want to support

Awesome! The best way to support us is to recommend it to your classmates/colleagues/friends, write blog posts and tutorials on SeaQL projects and help out other users in the community. It is difficult enough to keep an open source afloat, so every little help matters, especially if it can directly/indirectly lightening the core team's mental load.

## I want to sponsor
