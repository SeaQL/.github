## Our Mission
We help developers in building data intensive applications in Rust, whether they are web services (GraphQL, gRPC, REST), command line tools or apps.

## Our Vision
In the long term, we want to support all open source SQL, NewSQL and NoSQL databases, providing a uniform developer experience to data analytics, transaction processing and other data engineering work.

## Our Values
Community driven. Embrace the async Rust ecosystem. Welcome developers from other languages.

## Our commitment

We are committed to nurturing the next generation of open source developers. We provide internship experience tailored for university students - Seaography and StarfishQL are both excellent projects developed by interns under SeaQL.

## Community

Your participation is what makes us unique; your adoption is what drives us forward. Please star our repos! Every ‚≠ê counts!
