## Our Mission
We help developers in building data intensive applications in Rust, whether they are web services (GraphQL, gRPC, REST), command line tools or apps.

## Our Vision
In the long term, we want to support all open source SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases, providing a uniform developer experience to transaction processing, stream processing and other data engineering work.

## Our Values
Community driven. Embrace the async Rust ecosystem. Welcome developers from other languages.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to nurturing the next generation of open source developers. We provide internship experience tailored for university students - Seaography and StarfishQL are both excellent projects developed by interns under SeaQL.

## Our Community

Your participation is what makes us unique; your adoption is what drives us forward. Thank you all in the Rust community for making SeaQL what it is today. You are also invited to shape it's future! Please star our repos, every ⭐ counts!
