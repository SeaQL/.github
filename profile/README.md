## Our Mission
We help developers in building data intensive applications in Rust, whether they are web services (GraphQL, gRPC, REST), command line tools or apps.

## Our Vision
In the long term, we want to support all open source SQL, NewSQL and NoSQL databases, providing a uniform developer experience to data analytics, transaction processing and schema management.

## Our Values
Community driven. Embrace the async Rust ecosystem. Welcome developers from other languages.
